Skin's Ls: Toasts


Any errors about Could Not Open X addon aren't fixable, Its errors that have been getting sent to the Lua Warning and its not something an addon dev can fix. I suggest you get [No Warnings](https://github.com/Nevcairiel/FilterLuaInterfaceWarnings) addon to hide these + other ones that can't be fixed.
